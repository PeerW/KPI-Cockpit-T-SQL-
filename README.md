# Key Performance Indicator Cockpit - Data Model 

## Disclaimer
This repository is solely available to demonstrate my T-SQL skills and Data Modelling skills.  
I will not dive into details about the project since most of the data is confidential.  

## Introduction - the project's aim
I worked and implemented this project during my time as student worker at Vestas A/S.
The project was successfully implemented and is currently used as a KPI managment tool within Vestas Power Solutions (2000+ employees).

The main objectives were:
- Developing an easy-to-use KPI management tool (Vice President level) to consolidate 200+ KPI's within Vestas Power Solutions
- Enable both manual and automatic data entry in real-time
- Introducing and deploying the solution by engaging and training 60+ stakeholders

## Technologies 
The Data Model was build using a Microsoft Azure SQL Database and written in T-SQL.   
The final project was then presented to stakeholders by using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) as a user interface and visualization tool.   
DAX was extensively utilized to implement the complex logic necessary for 200+ KPIs with different aggregations, formats, etc.   
[Microsoft Power Apps](https://flow.microsoft.com) was used to create an application embedded in the Power BI interface that enabled users to update KPI values in real-time.  
[Microsoft Power Automate](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) was utilized to automate workflows related to the project and enhance user experience.
